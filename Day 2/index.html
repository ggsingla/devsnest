      <p>Dear Sir</p>
      <p>
        I am writing this letter to take the permission regarding the
        participation in the coding workshop organized by <em>Devnest</em> on
        their discord server. The coding workshop will be teaching the
        participants about web development including both front end and back
        end. This is a great opportunity for anybody who is interested in
        website development.
      </p>
      <p>I will take complete care that my regular studies are not compromised due to this workshop. I will be very grateful to you for allowing me to participate in this course</p>
      <p>Your truly <br><span>
